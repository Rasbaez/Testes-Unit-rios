In this Project we implemented several functions in the resolution of the proposed requirements and/or unit tests to guarantee that the implementations of the functions are correct, according to what is being requested in each statement.

In this project, we were able to:

Write unit tests using the NodeJS Jest module to verify the correct functioning of the functions;
Write functions so that they meet already implemented tests;
Write tests and functions using a test-driven development approach.



1. Implement the average function
The average function takes a variable-length array and returns the average of the values ​​received. If the function receives some non-numeric value or an empty array, the value `undefined` must be returned.

All results must be rounded to integers. Ex: 4.6 becomes 5; 1.3 becomes 1. The average.spec.js file contains the tests for average already implemented. Implement the function in the src/average.js file so that it meets the proposed tests.


2. Implement the test cases for the numbers function
The `numbers` function takes a variable-length array and returns `true` if all parameters are of type 'number' and `false` otherwise.

3. Implement the vqv function
Use template literals to write a function that takes its name and age and returns the paragraph described below:

4. Implement the test cases for the circle function
The `circle` function receives the radius of a circle and returns an object containing its information: Radius, Area and Circumference. If no radius is specified, the function returns `undefined`.


5. Implement the createStudent function
The `createStudent` function takes a **name** as a parameter, and returns an object containing two keys:

name, containing the name passed as a parameter;
feedback, containing a function that returns the phrase 'Hey good person!' when being called.

6. Implement the test cases for the productDetails function

7. Implement calculator and arrayGenerator functions

8. Implement the myCounter function
The myCounter function has two nested loops that insert values ​​into an array. As we can see, they add values ​​to the array until its stop condition.

9. Implement the test cases for the getCharacter function
The `getCharacter` function receives a string representing the name of a character and returns an object containing its name, its class and its phrases.

10. Implement the createMenu function as well as your test cases
This last requirement will guide you through a rich process of Test Driven Development or TDD - Test Driven Development
